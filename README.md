Lateral will show a bar in the center of your screen indicating:
* Duration of active SnD (yellow), left/white number and potential duration of SnD, based on the CP of your current target (blue), right/green number
* Do the same for Taste for Blood, Envenom, Expose Armor

Slash command alias:
**/lateral** or **/lat**

Available commands:
* /lat toggle - Enable/disable the tracker
* /lat debug - UNIT_CASTEVENT logging to chat

Look and feel has to be adjusted by editing Lateral.lua (sorry)
