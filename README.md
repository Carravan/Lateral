in the center of your screen.

Each tracker bar shows
* Remaining duration, represented by the top-layer bar and the number in seconds remaining in white
* Potential duration, represented by the bottom-layer bar and the potential duration of the buff/debuff in green

Additionally
* Taste for Blood shows the damage increase of your active buff and the duration of Rupture on your target if landed.
* Expose Armor will only show a potential bar with 5CP
* Tracker bars are only active when their respective talents are active (except SnD)
* Display your Blade Flurry status
