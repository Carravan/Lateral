Lateral will show bars which represent
* Slice and Dice
* Combined Taste for Blood and Rupture
* Envenom
* Expose Armor

in the center of your screen.

Each tracker bar shows
* Remaining duration, represented by the top-layer bar and the number in seconds remaining in white
* Potential duration, represented by the bottom-layer bar and the potential duration of the buff/debuff in green

Additionally
* Taste for Blood shows the damage increase of your active buff and the duration of Rupture on your target if landed.
* Expose Armor will only show a potential bar with 5CP
* Tracker bars are only active when their respective talents are active (except SnD)

Tracked tier sets and trinkets
* Dispatch (T3.5 2pc)
* Nightblade (T3.5 5pc)
* Shieldrender Talisman
* Kiss of the Spider
* Slayer's Crest

* Venomous Totem

At buffcap
* All timers, bars, tier set proccs and trinkets will continue to work.
