# Lateral
Vanilla WoW Rogue Slice and Dice tracker, vaguely inspired by EventHorizon.

Lateral will show a bar in the center of your screen indicating:
* Duration of active SnD (yellow), left/white number
* Potential duration of SnD, based on the CP of your current target (blue), right/green number

Slash command alias:
**/lateral** or **/lat**

Available commands:

* /lat toggle - Enable/disable the tracker
* /lat lock - Lock frame position
* /lat unlock - Unlock frame position, drag with left mouse while holding ALT modifier
* /lat reset - Reset position to center
* /lat status - Show current status (debug stuff)

Look and feel has to be adjusted by editing Lateral.lua (sorry)
